Modelling Problem:

You have a fleet of cabs at your disposal, and each cab has a location, determined by it’s latitude and longitude.
A customer can call one of your taxis by providing their location, and you must assign the nearest taxi to the customer.
Some customers are particular that they only ride around in pink cars, for hipster reasons. You must support this ability.
When the cab is assigned to the customer, it can no longer pick up any other customers
If there are no taxis available, you reject the customer's request.
The customer ends the ride at some location. The cab waits around outside the customer’s house, and is available to be assigned to another customer.
When the customer ends the ride, log the total amount the customer owes
The price is 1 dogecoin per minute, and 2 dogecoin per kilometer. Pink cars cost an additional 5 dogecoin.
